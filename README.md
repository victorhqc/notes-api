# Notes API

## Introduction

I've been using Google Keep for some time now, and I loved the App. Until I accidentally removed a note forever,
at some point, I guess with my phone, the text from some important note was modified, and I have no way to see
how the note was before that accidental change. That was pretty frustrating at the time, and as Google Keep
is a closed project, I decided to make my very own and open source Note application. This of course being the
standalone API.
