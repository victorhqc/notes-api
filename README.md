# Notes API

## Introduction

I've been using Google Keep for some time now, and I loved the App. Until I accidentally removed a note forever,
at some point, I guess with my phone, the text from some important note was modified, and I have no way to see
how the note was before that accidental change. That was pretty frustrating at the time, and as Google Keep
is a closed project, I decided to make my very own and open source Note application. This of course being the
standalone API.

## Requirements

In order to run this repository, you'll need to install the following packages:

+ Node >= 6
+ NPM
+ MongoDB *(Or any other DB you like that is supported by the loopback-juggler)*
+ nodemon *Optional development package*

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Run API

```sh
node .
```

Or use nodemon to refresh the API with every change you make (For development)

#### Install Nodemon

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
```

#### Run with Nodemon

```sh
nodemon .
```
